# EntropyLab — Contributor Compensation Policy (501(c)(3) version)

*Draft v0.1 — adopt and date once reviewed by the Board. Keep this on file, along with meeting minutes documenting each approval, as the paper trail that protects both the Organization's exempt status and individual directors from personal excise-tax exposure under IRC §4958.*

## 1. Purpose

This policy governs how contributors to EntropyLab may request and receive payment for work on the project, in a way consistent with 501(c)(3) rules against private inurement and excess benefit to insiders. It exists to keep compensation decisions **transparent, independently approved, and reasonable**, and to make clear that contributing to EntropyLab never requires accepting payment.

**How this differs from a for-profit structure:** under an LLC or standalone company, a founder recusing from their own pay vote is generally sufficient. Under 501(c)(3) rules, recusal alone is not enough for anyone the IRS would treat as a "disqualified person" (which includes founders, directors, and officers, regardless of formal title) — approval must come from a body with **no** disqualified persons involved in that decision, following the process below, or the Organization risks losing the legal protection this process is designed to provide (see §4).

## 2. Two contributor tracks

- **Unpaid / volunteer contributors** — the default. No paperwork, no obligation, no expectation of payment. Most contributions to EntropyLab fall here.
- **Paid contributors** — contributors who take on defined, scoped work and request compensation from Organization funds. Paid work is always tied to a specific deliverable or milestone, not an open-ended salary.

A contributor can move between tracks freely.

## 3. What qualifies for payment

- Defined engineering work (features, security fixes, audits, test coverage)
- Documentation, build/release tooling, infrastructure maintenance
- Security review or audit work, especially on the derivation/crypto core
- Other work explicitly scoped and approved in advance (see §4)

Payment is **for the work**, not for status or role — being a founder/director doesn't entitle someone to payment; it entitles them to *request* it under this same process, and it means their own approval doesn't count toward it.

## 4. Approval process — rebuttable presumption of reasonableness

This process is designed to create a "rebuttable presumption of reasonableness" under IRC §4958 — meaning that if followed, the burden shifts to the IRS to prove compensation was excessive, rather than the Organization having to prove it was reasonable after the fact.

4.1 **Scope submission.** Contributor (or a director/officer on their behalf) submits a short written scope: what the work is, estimated hours or milestone, and requested amount.
4.2 **Comparability check.** The amount is checked against comparable rates — e.g., published rates for comparable open-source security/dev work, or grants OpenSats/Brink/similar sponsors have paid for similar scoped work elsewhere. The comparison itself is documented in writing.
4.3 **Independent approval — not merely recusal.** The request is approved **only** by directors with no financial interest in that specific payment (the "Independent Directors" defined in the Bylaws). Any director or officer with a financial interest — including the requester, and including any director whose own future compensation could be seen as linked (e.g., a co-founder who might request similar payment later) — **must not be present for the discussion or vote**, not just abstain. **If the Organization does not currently have enough Independent Directors to form a quorum for this vote (Bylaws §6.4 sets this floor at two), the payment cannot be approved through this process until it does.** This is a firmer floor than a simple "find a third disinterested person" fallback — an ad hoc approver who lacks real independence or board authority may not preserve the rebuttable-presumption protection. In practice, this means recruiting a single independent director is enough to incorporate and operate, but not enough to pay anyone — including either founder — until a second is seated.
4.4 **Contemporaneous documentation.** Before or reasonably soon after the decision, the approving body documents: the terms approved, the date, who was present/voting, the comparability data relied on and how it was obtained, and confirmation that interested parties were excluded from the vote. This must be recorded close in time to the decision — reconstructing it later after a question arises does not satisfy the requirement.

## 5. Payment mechanics

- Paid contributors are compensated as independent contractors, not employees, unless the Organization's staffing needs change.
- Payments are requested and paid through the Organization's own accounts, not informally peer-to-peer from donation wallets — this matters even more for a 501(c)(3) than a for-profit entity, since commingling personal and organizational funds is a common trigger for IRS scrutiny.
- **US contributors:** collect a Form W-9 and report payments on Form 1099-NEC.
- **Non-US contributors:** collect a Form W-8BEN (or W-8BEN-E for an entity) instead of a W-9. Payments are generally reported on Form 1042-S rather than 1099-NEC, and may be subject to withholding depending on the contributor's country and whether the work is treated as US-source — an open-source Bitcoin-FOSS contributor pool is likely to be predominantly non-US, so this isn't an edge case and should be set up correctly from the first paid engagement rather than patched later.
- BTC-denominated payments are recorded at fair market value (USD) as of the payment date, for both the Organization's Form 990 reporting and the contractor's 1099/1042-S records.

## 6. Recordkeeping

For every paid engagement, keep on file:
- The written scope/request
- The comparability note used to justify the amount
- Who approved it, confirming they were not a disqualified person with a financial interest in that request
- Confirmation the vote met the independent-quorum requirement in §4.3
- Date and amount paid, and BTC/USD value at time of payment

This log is what protects both the Organization's exempt status and individual directors personally if a donor, grantmaker, state charity regulator, or the IRS ever asks how compensation decisions were made. Unlike a private company, some of this (via Form 990) becomes part of the Organization's public record — so the standard here is "would this hold up if published," not just "would this satisfy an internal audit."

## 7. What this policy does not permit, regardless of approval

- Compensation arrangements that function as disguised profit-sharing or equity (e.g., a percentage of donations/grants received, rather than payment for defined work)
- Payment approved by a body that includes any disqualified person with a financial interest in that specific request, even if they abstained rather than left the room
- Any arrangement where the amount was set *before* comparability data was gathered, rather than justified by it

These aren't matters of degree — an arrangement that crosses these lines risks the Organization's tax-exempt status itself, not just an individual excise tax.

## 8. Changes to this policy

Any change to this policy should go through the same independent-approval principle in §4 — directors or officers who stand to benefit from loosening the rules should not be the ones voting to loosen them, and any such change should itself be documented per §6.
